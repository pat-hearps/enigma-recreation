        <p><font size="2">The Enigma machine is an
        electro-mechanical device. It consists of a keyboard
        (German QWERTZ layout), a lamp panel, representing the
        alphabet, and three or four rotors. One or more rotors
        move on each key stroke. The rotors and plugboard
        translate the depressed key into a burning lamp,
        representing the encoded letter. The machine has a
        compartment for a 4 volt battery. Some versions have a
        switch to select between internal battery and external
        power supply. Other versions have a transformer to
        connect the machine to the AC mains.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">The picture above shows the wiring. To
        simplify the example, only four of each of the components
        are shown. In reality, there are 26 lamps, keys,
        plugboard sockets and wiring connections inside the
        rotors. The current flows from the battery [1] through
        the depressed bi-directional letter-switch [2] to the
        plugboard [3]. The plugboard allows rewiring the
        connections between keyboard [2] and fixed entry wheel
        [4]. Next, the current proceeds through the - unused, and
        therefore closed - socket [3] via the entry wheel [4]
        through the cross-wirings of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma)
        or four (Kriegmarine M4) rotors [5] and enters the
        reflector [6]. The reflector returns the current, via a
        different path, back through the rotors [5] and entry
        wheel [4], and proceeds through the plugboard again and
        through the plug 'S' connected with a cable [8] to plug
        'D', and another bi-directional switch [9] to light-up
        the lamp.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Note that depressing a key will first
        step the rotors and then the sent the current through the
        rotors en the light bulb. If the key is released the lamp
        will no longer light up. Therefore, when no key is
        depressed, the rotor position of the <em>previous</em>
        encrypted letter is visible!</font></p>

        German) are the most important elements of the machine.
        These round disks [9], approximately 4 inch in diameter,
        are made from metal or bakelite and have a core with 26
        spring-loaded contacts [6] on the right side, scramble
        wired [5] to 26 flat contacts [4] on the left side, with
        a hollow axle in the center [8]. On the outside of the
        wiring core there's a movable ring [3] with 26 numbers or
        letters and a notch [1]. This ring is rotatable and is
        locked with a sprinloaded pin (Wehrmacht) [7] or two
        springloaded arcs (Kriegmarine) into any of the 26
        positions. Changing the position of the ring will change
        the position of the notch and alphabet, relative to the
        internal wiring. This setting is called the ring setting
        or Ringstellung and its position is visible by a dot
        marking [2]. Each rotor has on its left a notch [1] and
        on its right a ratchet [10]. These are used by the
        stepping mechanism to advance the rotors. The internal
        wiring is different for each rotor. This wiring
        represents a substitution encryption. The combination of
        several rotors, in ever-changing positions relative to
        each other, is what makes the encryption so complex.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The machine was introduced with three
        rotors. In 1939 the set was extended to five rotors,
        marked with Roman numerals I, II, III, IV and V, all with
        a single notch. The Kriegmarine extended this set of
        rotors with another three rotors called VI, VII and VIII,
        each with two notches. In 1942, the Kriegsmarine M4
        introduced a fourth rotor. To achieve this, the wide B
        and C reflectors from the three rotor version were
        replaced by thin B and C reflectors, leaving room for the
        special fourth rotor. The fourth rotors were of two
        configurations, named Beta and Gamma, with spring-loaded
        contacts on both sides, making them incompatible with the
        other eight rotors.<br clear="all">

                <p><font size="2">The reflector, Umkehrwalze or
                UKW in German, is a unique feature of the Enigma
                machine. On the internal wiring of all movable
                rotors, each letter can be wired with any other
                letter. An 'A' could be wired to 'F', where the
                'F' is wired to 'K'. In the reflector, the
                connections are made in pairs. If the 'A' is
                wired to the 'F', this means the 'F' is also
                wired to the 'A', resulting in a reciprocal
                encryption. The advantage for the operator is
                clear. Encryption and decryption is possible with
                the same machine setting and wiring.
                Unfortunately, a letter can never be encrypted
                into itself, and this feature opened the door to

                <p><font size="2">During the Second World War two
                types of reflector, B and C, were used. Both had
                26 spring-loaded contacts on the right side. The
                four-rotor Kriegsmarine Enigmas used special thin
                reflectors, also called B and C, but with wiring
                that was different from the wiring of the
                three-rotor Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe reflectors.
                However, if the thin Kriegsmarine reflector B was
                used together with the fourth Beta rotor in
                A-position and A-ringsetting or the C reflector
                with Gamme rotor, these reflectors were
                compatible with the three-rotor versions,
                enabling communication between different machine
                types. The thin reflectors had flats contacts and
                were used in combination with the special fourth
                Beta or Gamma rotors with spring-loaded contacts
                on both sides. In the final days of the war, a
                special type D reflector was introduced. It was
                an adjustable reflector with 12 wires and 24
                plugs. The 13th wire was a fixed connection.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2">The reflector (Umkehrwalze or
                UKW in German) is a unique feature of the Enigma
                machine. On the normal rotors, each letter can be
                wired with any other letter. An 'A' could be
                wired to 'F', while the 'F' is wired to 'K'. In
                the reflector, the connections are made in loop
                pairs. In the case of the wide B reflector, the
                'A' is wired to the 'Y' which means that the 'Y'
                is also wired to the 'A', resulting in a
                reciprocal encryption. The advantage of this
                design is that encryption and decryption are
                possible with the same machine setting and
                wiring. Unfortunately, a letter can never be
                encrypted into itself, a property that opened the
                door to cryptanalysis, making the job easier to
                the codebreakers.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2">A rotor consists of two main
                parts. First, we have the movable outer ring with
                the alphabet (visible in the little window) and
                the notch (responsible for the stepping).
                Secondly, there's the core with the internal
                wiring (the actual encryption) and its 2 x 26
                contacts. This core is fixed to the large
                thumb-wheel, which is used to manually set the
                rotor position. Changing the position of the
                outer ring is called the ring setting or
                'Ringstellung' and will change the position of
                the alphabet ring and its notch (turnover-point),
                relative to the internal wiring core.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In the drawings below we use
                the Enigma rotor type I (Roman one). The movable
                ring is the vertical gray field. The wiring core,
                and the thumbwheel that is fixed to it, are white
                (in reality, the white field does not carry
                letters). The rotor position is indicated by the
                letter in the black frame (the little window in
                the machine cover). The little black field to the
                right of the ring is the locking pin, to lock the
                ring's position, and indicates the ringsetting. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The first example shows how
                rotor I (with ring setting A-01) encodes two
                consecutive depressed A keys. On the left you see
                rotor I in the A position (visible in the little
                window). The signal, coming from the depressed A
                key, arrives at the A position, enters at the A
                contact and exits at the E contact on the E
                position.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">On the right, the rotor has
                stepped to the B position. The signal again
                arrives at the A position, but enters now at the
                B contact and exits at the K contact. Since the
                complete rotor has stepped one position, the K
                contact is now in the J position and the signal
                therefore exits at the J position towards the
                next rotor.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2"><img src="enigmatech_files/rotorencode.jpg" title="Image © D Rijmenants 2011" width="424" hspace="2" height="474" border="1"></font></p>
                <p><font size="2">On the rotors, the
                'Ringstellung' is marked by the locking pin
                (Wehrmacht) or by a dot on the wiring core
                (Kriegsmarine) and this marking shows the
                location of the first contact (A or 01) of the
                rotor core. Ring setting F or 06 thus will allign
                the letter F or figure 06 on the outer ring with
                the first contact of the rotor, marked by the pin
                or dot. When changing the ring setting one
                position, the encryption is shifted one position.
                (the rotor turnover point remains at the same
                letter, because the notch is located at the
                alphabet ring). The ring setting should not be
                confused with the rotor position, which is the
                letter on the alphabet ring, visible in the
                little window of the machine cover.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Below are two examples to
                explain the ring setting. On the left, rotor I
                has a ring setting B-02 (pin or dot at B) and the
                rotor is in the A position (A visible in little
                window). The signal arrives at the A position,
                enters at the Z contact and exits at the J
                contact. Due to the ring setting, the wiring core
                is shifted one position and so do the exit
                contacts. Therefore, exit contact J is now in the
                K position and the signal exits at the K position
                towards the next rotor.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">On the right, we have the same
                rotor I with ring setting F-06 and the rotor in
                the Y position. The signal arrives at the A
                position, enters at the T contact and exits at
                the P contact. However, the combination of the
                rotor position and its ring settings causes a
                shift of seven positions of the exit contacts.
                Therefore, exit contact P is now in the U
                position and the signal exits at the W position
                towards the next rotor.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2"><img src="enigmatech_files/rotorencodewithring.jpg" title="Image © D Rijmenants 2011" width="424" height="474" border="1"></font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Remember that, when depressing
                a key, the rotors advance <u>before</u> the
                electrical signal runs through the rotors.
                Therefore, to examine the current flow through
                the rightmost rotor in A position, the rotor must
                be set in the Z position before depressing the
                key (this also counts for the other rotors if
                they are due to step). In the examples above, no
                plugs are set on the plugboard and the signal
                runs directly from the A key, through the entry
                rotor, to rotor I.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">The flow of the signal,
                described above, is from right to left: the
                signal, coming from the plugboard arrives at the
                rotor entry plate (located on the right side of
                the rotor cradle) and proceeds, from right to
                left, through the right-most, middle and
                left-most rotor. Once the signal has passed all
                three or four rotors, the reflector returns this
                signal back trough the left, middle and right
                rotor via another path, causing a second
                completely different scramble of the signal. It
                is obvious that the combination of rotor wiring,
                rotor position and ring offset created a complex
                encoding. A single step of one rotor will produce
                a completely different path trough all three
                rotors.</font></p>

                towards the rotors. Each pawl is placed both over
                the notch ring of the rotor to its right, and the
                teeth of the rotor to its left. If a rotor is in
                its notch position, its pawl can move into that
                notch and push into the teeth of the next left
                rotor, moving that rotor one step further. If the
                rotor on its right is not in the notch position
                the pawl slides over the notch ring of the right
                side rotor and will be unable to grab into the
                teeth. Since there is no rotor on the right side
                of the first rotor, the right most pawl will
                engage the first rotor on every depressing of a
                key. If no key is pressed, the pawl axle [2]
                forces the pawls [3] against pads on the bottom
                of the machine, pushing the pawls away from the
                rotors. This enables the operator to move the
                rotors freely by hand in both directions.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2">The position of the notch is
                different for each of the rotors. In the table
                below we can see that rotor I has a notch on
                letter Y. If this notch is positioned in front of
                the pawl, the letter Q is visible in the little
                window. Therefore, the rotor to the left of rotor
                I will step if rotor I steps from Q to R
                (cryptanalists used the mnemonic <u>R</u>oyal <u>F</u>lags
                <u>W</u>ave <u>K</u>ings <u>A</u>bove to remember
                the positions of the rotors after turnover).
                Notice that the Kriegsmarine rotors VI, VII and
                VIII have two notches. This advances the rotor to
                their left twice as fast as the other rotors.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><strong>Important note on the Stepping
        Sequence</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The rotors appear to work as a normal
        odometer, with the right-most rotor always stepping on
        each key stroke and the other rotors stepping after a
        complete cycle of the previous rotor, but there is an
        important difference due to the system of pawls and
        teeth. The middle rotor will advance on the next step of
        the first rotor a second time in a row, if the middle
        rotor is in its own turnover position. This is called the
        double-step. Below and example of such a sequence when
        the rotors III  II - I are used:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>KDO KDP, KDQ, KER, LFS, LFT,
        LFU </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">As you can observe, stepping from Q to
        R advances the middle rotor, and on the next step that
        middle rotor steps again, advancing the third rotor also.
        This is caused by the mechanical design of pawls and
        ratchets. There are three pawls that are all three
        activated on every key stroke. Each pawl is half
        positioned on the index ring (carrying a notch) of the
        rotor on its right, and half positioned above the 26
        teeth of the rotor on its left (viewed from the point of
        the operator). A rotors ring prevents the pawl from
        pushing into the teeth of the next-left rotor. When a
        notch occurs in a ring, the pawl can drop into that notch
        and push into the teeth of the next-left rotor. Since the
        right-most pawl is not above an index ring it will
        continuously advance the right-most rotor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Once the right-most rotor has stepped
        and the middle (spring-loaded) pawl can drop down in the
        right rotor's notch, it will engage the middle rotor's
        teeth, pushing the middle rotor one step. An identical
        event will take place when the middle rotor's notch
        enables the third pawl to drive the teeth of the
        left-most rotor. A rotor will not only advance if its
        teeth are catched, but also when a pawl pushes into its
        notch. This situation creates a double-step of the middle
        rotor: the right rotor steps and the middle pawl takes
        the middle rotor one step further. If the middle rotor
        has moved by this step into its own notch position, then,
        on the next step, the left-most pawl catches the teeth of
        the left-most rotor, but the same pawl also pushes in the
        middle rotor's notch, moving it a second time in a row.
        Note that a double notched rotor in the middle position
        will also have two double steps.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The stepping mechanism, as explained
        above, is used on the Wehrmacht and Kriegsmarine Enigma.
        The four-rotor Kriegsmarine M4 is derived from the three
        rotor version without changing the rotor advance
        mechanism or adding a fourth pawl. Therefore the fourth
        rotor doesn't move and can only be adjusted manually. The
        Enigma-G, used by the Abwehr (German Intelligence) has a
        different mechanism. The Enigma-G has a rotating
        reflector and three rotors with multiple notches, rotated
        by a gear box.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2">In 1930, the plugboard or
                Steckerbrett was introduced on the first
                Wehrmacht Enigma version. The plugboard is
                situated on the front of the machine. Without an
                inserted plug, the current flows from the
                switches, controlled by the keyboard, directly to
                the entry rotor. Inserting a cable results in
                swapping the two involved letters before
                proceeding to the entry rotor. Each machine was
                by default equipped with a set of 10 cables. The
                plugbord was an important improvement of the
                machines encryption strength.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Each letter has two jacks.
                Inserting a plug disconnects the upper jack,
                connected to the keyboard, and the lower jack,
                connected to the entry wheel. The other end of
                the cross-wired cable is inserted into another
                letter's jack, swapping the connections of the
                two letters. The current passes through the
                plugboard once on its way to the rotors and
                another time on its way to the light bulbs.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2">A handy feature, used on the
                Kriegsmarine Enigma was the Schreibmax. This
                little printer could print the alphabet on a
                small paper ribbon. This excluded the need for a
                second operator, reading the lamps and writing
                the letters down. The Schreibmax was placed on
                top of the Enigma machine and was connected to
                the lamp panel; to install the printer, the lamp
                cover and all light bulbs had to be removed.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">Another accessory was the
                remote lamp panel. If the machine was equipped
                with an extra panel, the wooden case of the
                Enigma was wider and could store the extra panel.
                There was a lamp panel version that could be
                connected afterwards, but that required, just as
                with the Schreibmax, the lamp panel and light
                bulbs to be removed. The remote panel made it
                possible for a person to read the decrypted text,
                without giving the operator access to it.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2">In 1944, the Luftwaffe
                introduced an extra plugboard switch, called the
                Uhr (clock). The Uhr was a little box, containing
                a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the
                default plug cables. After connecting the plugs,
                as determined in the daily key sheet, the
                operator could turn the switch to one of the 40
                positions, each position resulting in a different
                combination of plug wiring. Most of these cable
                connections are, unlike the default cables, not
                pair-wise.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">To calculate the mathematical security
        we have to find all possible different settings of the
        machine. Therefore, we need to look at the following
        properties of the machine: the selection and order of the
        rotors, their wiring, the ring setting on each of the
        rotors, the startposition of these rotors at the
        beginning of the message, the reflector and the plugboard
        settings. Now, there are different ways to calculate a
        grand total of this. In </font><a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/NSA-Comb.html" target="_blank"><font size="2">this NSA publication</font></a><font size="2">, all possible variations of wiring in each of
        the rotors and the reflector was included. This results
        in an astronomical 3 x 10<sup>114</sup>. However, these
        misleading figures represent all theoretically possible
        variations of the machine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Unfortunately for the Germans, the
        Allied codebreakers knew the machine, the rotors and the
        internal wiring of these rotors. Therefore, they only had
        to take in account the actual possible ways you could set
        the machine, the actual key settings or key space. This
        is what we call the practical security, which is far less
        than the theoretical security in the case of Enigma. For
        the German cryptologists, a single rotor could be wired
        in 4 x 10<sup>26</sup> different ways. Combining three
        rotors and a reflector quickly gives you astronomical
        figures. For the Allied codebreakers, who knew the wring
        of the rotors, there were only 26 different variations
        for a single rotor, that is, the 26 positions it could
        have in the machine. They didn't have to search through
        the immense number of possible wirings. The German
        cryptologists made a critical mistake by ignoring Auguste
        Kerckhoff's law that the security of a device may never
        depend on the secrecy of the system (i.e. rotor wiring,
        design), which will be compromised sooner or later
        anyhow, but only on the secrecy of the key (i.e. rotor
        selection and plugboard). In the interesting </font><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161-110391891801" target="_blank"><font size="2">R.A. Ratcliff paper</font></a><font size="2"> for Cryptologia you can read how dangerous it
        is to rely on theoritical security.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Let us look at all the things we can
        actually set in the machine and are unknown to the
        codebreaker. In our example, we take the three-rotor
        Wehrmacht Enigma with default B reflector and selection
        out of 5 rotors. We use 10 plug cables on the plugboard,
        the default number of cables, issued with the machine
        (don't ask me why they didn't provide 11 cables, which
        gave far more possible combinations)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To select 3 rotors out of a possible 5,
        there are 60 combinations (5 x 4 x 3). Each rotor, in
        other words its internal wiring, can be set in any of 26
        positions. Therefore, with 3 rotors there are 17,576
        different rotor positions (26 x 26 x 26). The ring on
        each rotor holds the rotor labeling (which doesn't matter
        here) and a notch that affects the stepping of the
        next-left rotor. Each ring can be set in any of 26
        positions. As there is no rotor to the left of the third
        (most-left) rotor, only the rings of the most-right and
        middle rotor affect the calculation. This gives 676 ring
        combinations (26 x 26).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The plugboard provides the largest
        chunk of possible different settings. For the first
        cable, one side can have any of the 26 positions and its
        other side any of the 25 remaining positions. However,
        since a combination and its reverse are identical (A-B is
        the same as B-A) we have to ignore all doubles in all
        possible combinations for one cable, giving (26 x 25) /
        (1! x 2<sup>1</sup>) or 325 unique ways to set one cable.
        For two cables, we have (26 x 25) for the first cable
        and, since two sockets are already used, (24 x 23) for
        the second cable. We now have to take in account the
        doubles for two cables, giving (26 x 25 x 24 x 23) / (2!
        x 2<sup>2</sup>) = 44,850 unique ways to set two cables.
        For three cables we have (26 x 25 x 24 x 23 x 22 x 21) /
        (3! x 2<sup>3</sup>) = 3,453,450 combinations, and so on.
        Thus, with the default 10 cables we have
        150,738,274,937,250 different combinations. The formula,
        with <em>n</em> as the number of cables, is 26! / (26 - 2<em>n</em>)!
        · <em>n</em>! · 2<sup><em>n</em></sup></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In total, this gives: 60 x 17,576 x 676
        x 150,738,274,937,250 = <strong>107,458,687,327,250,619,360,000</strong>
        or <strong>1.07 x 10</strong><sup><strong>23</strong></sup></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">So, in real life, the Wehrmacht Enigma
        machine could be set in 1.07 x 10<sup>23</sup> different
        ways, which is comparable with a 77 bit key.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">There are some comments we should add
        to this number. In reality, the maximum period of the
        rotors - the number of steps before the machine repeats
        itself - is slightly less than 17,576. This is caused by
        the double-step feature of the stepping mechanism. The
        actual period depends on the type of rotor. The three
        double-notched Naval rotors will have an even smaller
        period than the Wehrmacht rotors as they produce more
        double steps of the middle rotor. The maximum period
        however is no part of the variables that can be set and
        therefore do not influence the key space. The Wehrmacht
        machine could be equipped with either the B or C
        reflector. In general, radio nets always used the same
        reflector, as the use of different reflectors created
        logistical, procedural and practical problems. If
        nonetheless taken in account, the choice between B and C
        reflector would only double the key space.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The adding of a fourth rotor for the
        Naval Enigma M4 to improve its security was a nice but
        useless addition. The non-moving fourth rotor complicated
        the machine only by a factor 26 and, together with the
        thin reflector, could be considered as a settable
        reflector with 26 positions, of which the Allies quickly
        found the wiring (after 10 months of panic). The
        introduction of 8 naval rotors on the Kriegsmarine M3 and
        later on the four-rotor M4 was a far better approach.
        They increased the rotor combinations from 60 to 336, and
        brought in additional complexity with 3 multiple notched
        naval rotors VI VII and VIII. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Let us now calculate the practical key
        size of the four-rotor Kriegsmarine Enigma M4. This
        machine uses 3 normal rotors, selected from a set of 8
        (of which three with double notches). This gives 336
        rotor combinations (8 x 7 x 6). The M4 also has a special
        fourth rotor called Beta or Gamma (without a ring), which
        gives us 2 choices. These are not compatible with the
        other rotors and are only suitable as fourth (most left)
        rotor. The 4 rotors can be set in any of 456,976
        positions (26 x 26 x 26 x 26). The M4 had a smaller B or
        C reflector, to enable the placement of the fourth rotor.
        We don't include the choice of reflector as it was
        generally never changed. Again, only two rings were
        involved, as the third rotor didn't step the never moving
        fourth rotor. The M4 was also issued with 10 plug cables.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In total, this gives: 336 x 2 x 456,976
        x 676 x 150,738,274,937,250 = <strong>31,291,969,749,695,380,357,632,000</strong>
        or <strong>3.1 x 10</strong><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>,
        comparable with a 84 bit key. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This is about 291 times stronger than
        the Wehrmacht machine. This is due to the increased
        choice of rotors (already available on the M3 before the
        war) and the possible initial positions for 4 rotors
        instead of 3. However, although the fourth rotor did
        increase the key size, it failed to add to the complexity
        of the encryption itself, since it couldn't move during
        the enciphering proccess. A better solution would have
        been to completely re-wire some of the rotors on a
        regular basis. A single variable rotor wiring would
        multiply the key space with no less than 4 x 10<sup>26</sup>,
        which is far more than a settable reflector with its 7.8
        x 10<sup>12</sup> possible variations. A single
        practical, daily changed, re-wireable rotor, which has 4
        x 10<sup>26</sup> possible settings, would have been much
        more effective than the overestimated daily not-moving
        plugboard setting with only 2 x 10<sup>14</sup>
        variations (the plugboard was always in pairs). The use
        of such rotor, for instance in conjunction with a thin
        M4-like reflector and two out of four normal rotors,
        would be a true disaster for the codebreakers. However,
        introducing re-wireable rotors during wartime would be
        cumbersome and present a logistical and financial
        nightmare, just as the rewireable D reflector proved to
        be. Too little too late. The D reflector did scare the
        codebreakers initially, until they realized that the D
        reflector was used simultaniously with the default
        reflectors in the same radio nets, due to practical
        considerations. This dual use made it possible to break
        it even by hand. More about the D reflector and other
        attempts on the </font><a href="http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigma.htm"><font size="2">Enigma history</font></a><font size="2"> page.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Any crypto-expert would also discard
        the 17,576 ring combinations. Even with completely wrong
        ring settings, you will initially start with a correct
        plain text. As soon as you get garbled text, you adjust
        the ring of the most-right rotor (a 1/26 chance you're
        right) and if you're lucky you have no more trouble for
        the next 676 characters. If less lucky, you had to adjust
        the ring of the middle rotor after 26 letters. All done
        on-the-fly. Unfortunately for the Germans, the ingenious
        Turing Bombe design, with mirrored identical rotor packs,
        avoided the need to search through the immense number of
        plugboard settings, taking a factor 2 x 10<sup>14</sup>
        shortcut on the linking of their cribs (known piece of
        plain and ciphertext) to a given rotor setting.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Breaking the Enigma traffic was
        nonetheless an enormous challenge with a key setting that
        was extraordinary in the electro-mechanical era of those
        days. An exhaustive search on 1.07 x 10<sup>23</sup>
        settings was impossible in the 1940s and its comparable
        77 bit key is even huge for today's computer standards.
        To give you an idea of the size of that number, with 1.07
        x 10<sup>23</sup> sheets of paper (0.0039 inch each) you
        can build roughly 70,000,000 stacks of paper, each of
        them reaching from the Earth to the Sun. Also, 1.07 x 10<sup>23</sup>
        inches equals 288,500 light-year. A pretty big number!
        The Germans were correct in assuming that the Enigma was
        theoretically unbreakable. However, codebreaking is more
        than keys sizes and numbers, theoretical security and
        searching for the right combination. More on the how the
        Allies broke Enigma </font><a href="http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmauboats.htm"><font size="2">on this page</font></a><font size="2">.</font></p>
